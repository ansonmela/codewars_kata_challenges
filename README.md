# codewars_kata_challenges

This repository consists of codewars kata challenges that I am most proud of for developing a solution for.
There are many other katas that I have completed and they can be viewed on my codewars profile.
I make sure to do at least one kata challenge daily to upgrade my skills as a developer.
I am now moving into JavaScript challenges and these will be pushed to this repository.
JavaScript is my current focus on getting exceptionally skilled in.
